# Exploring the Python 3 interpreter with property (identity) tests

Built for MoT's Exploratory testing week, APril 2021

## Idea

Code to explore the interpreter. A rough framework for checking that values, when transformed and re-transformed, revert to themselves (i.e. x*2/2 = x). Framework allows for data generation and bulk testing, because I reckon we'll need it to see anything odd.

I expect that I'll run and change this as I go.

There is no UI. 

I'm not expecting to find bugs, but I'm expecting to find edge cases and weirdnesses.
